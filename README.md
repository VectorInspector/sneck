# sneck
Kinda effort Snake game written with SDL.

![It sure is snake.](preview.png?raw=true "It sure is snake.")

Control the snake with your arrow keys, eat the fruit and grow longer until you die. Nobody said being a snake was a good life. As for why snakes eat apples, these snakes are just built different. The game scales to nearest neighbour quality as you resize the window, so it always looks crystal clear. Oh and I made all the sprites and text.
